The resource I chose is freecodecamp. I like this resource because I believe it is very beginner friendly and it has the learner making projects throughout the learning process to help the learner retain their knowledge and practice what they know. The website is also very easy to navigate and has a linear pathway to learning the material required to be a web developer. Everything on freecodecamp is also free to learn so they don't withhold information behind a paywall. This website teaches HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
